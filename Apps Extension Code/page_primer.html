    Welcome writing students and instructors!
    <br> <br>
    We provide off-the-shelf writing exercises to help students systematically develop their writing ability. We use machine learning to add a modern twist to classic exercises in writing pedagogy.
    <br><br>
    We currently offer two exercises: 
  </p>
  
 


  <h4>Exercise I: Primer</h4>
  <i>Deliberate Practice for the Written Word</i><br><br>
  <text>
    Here we update a centuries-old writing routine made famous by Ben Franklin, where students rewrite the works of admired authors and study the differences in approach. Our algorithms automate away the tedium and provide new ways of analyzing writing structure.

      <h4>Exercise II: Pro</h4>
  <i>The Reverse Turing Test</i><br><br>
  <text> 
    In painting, music, sculpting, and chess, students deeply study the styles of master practitioners before developing their own. 
    In this exercise, students try to write like a famous author like Jane Austen or Mark Twain, and then try to fool our algorithm into thinking its authentic. We provide feedback on which sentences were convicing and which were not, which allows the student to hone their approach.
