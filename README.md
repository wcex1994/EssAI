# EssAI

EssAI is a Google Docs extension that provides exercises for high school and college writing instruction. We've designed two machine-learning enabled exercises that are intended to be:

* Scalable: EssAI provides easy-to-use and repeatable writing training that can be customized by instructors across fields and domains.
* Systematic: EssAI uses machine learning to enable a rigorous form of training called deliberate practice (described below), both by automating away tedious aspects of the exercises and by providing tight feedback loops. 

Our current beta version is framed around the writing styles of Jane Austen and Mark Twain.
