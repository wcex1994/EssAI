# EssAI

Writing is a major curriculum in North America's education system. Many creative writing courses start with imitating well-known authors’ styles as the first step of understanding English writing, and hopefully help develop one’s own style. The overall process requires continuous practices and useful instructor feedback, which is both time and resource intensive. 

EssAI tries to help writing style practice with majorly two aspects: scalability and systematic practice. 

*	Scalability: EssAI provides easy-to-use and repeatable writing style exercises that ask students to imitate the styles of master writers as Jane Austen or Mark Twain. 
*	Systematic practice: EssAI uses text classification (BERT) and stylometric analysis to provide instantaneous, quantified feedback on similarities and differences to their target.
