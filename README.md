EssAI is a Google Docs extension that provides exercises for high school and college writing instruction. We've designed two machine-learning enabled exercises that are intended to be:

* Scalable: EssAI provides easy-to-use and repeatable writing training that can be customized by instructors across fields and domains.


* Systematic: EssAI uses machine learning to enable a rigorous form of training called deliberate practice, both by automating away tedious aspects of the exercises and by providing tight feedback loops. 

Our current beta version is framed around the writing styles of Jane Austen and Mark Twain.

## Credits:

For our readability and lexical diversity scores, we modified the code from this repo by Hassaan Elahi to compose with our existing pipeline:

While we did not wind up using this code in the final product, we wanted to credit him for aiding our exploration. The modified portions from the repo are marked as such in the relevant files.

For the front end, there are small JavaScript / CSS snippets from Stack Overflow that solve some niche issues. They've been credited where they appear in the code.
